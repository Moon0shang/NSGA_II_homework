# NSGA_II_homework
It's the homework of nature calculating toooooooooooooo

requirements:
* use realnumber coding genetic algorithmn
* two object problems(ZDT), choose 3 testing problems
* multiobject problem(DTLZ), choose 3 testing problems

step flow:

initial population

Fast Undominated Sorting &  calculate Crowding distance

while generation:

    select parent population

    cross & mutation generate offspring

    concatenate parent and offspring to a new popuation

    Fast Undominated Sorting &  calculate Crowding distance

    use Elitism preservation strategy to generate next population
